# eda-project-1
Course Project 1 for the Exploratory Data Analysis Course (Coursera). It is very important that you have the data file (the .txt) in your working directory. Once you have it there, go nuts and try out my scripts, and don't be too harsh with my grade!

By the way, this project uses the dplyr package. If you don't have it, you should install it using install.packages("dplyr"). I highly recommend this package for manipulating data.
